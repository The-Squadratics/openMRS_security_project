### Alignment of evidence with what the software (OpenMRS) supports (Task 3) 
---

#### Case 1 - Form Data

The top claim in the chain suggests that OpenMRS is resilient against the XSS attacks which is rebutted by an argument that unless malicious files can be injected through parameter injection. OpenMRS is not resilient to XSS attacks. In order to support it, the claim was that the software is resilient against parameter injection. This was rebutted by the argument stating that OpenMRS is resilient against parameter injection until malicious files can be inserted by stored XSS and HTTP headers. This was countered by stating that OpenMRS does strong input validation of strings and files. This was supported by the evidence that OpenMRS has several functions which proves that the software is resilient against malicious files injected through stored XSS and HTTP headers.

OpenMRS has several functions to filter untrusted user input and prevent XSS.

* String encodeHtmlContent(String input) - This function allows untrusted data to be safely displayed in HTML. This is mainly achieved by converting < and > symbols to &#60; and &#62; respectively. This kind of filtering will prevent XSS with script tag injection.
* String encodeHtmlAttribute(String input) - This function allows untrusted data to be safely displayed in HTML attributes. This is mainly achieved by converting " and ' symbols to &#34; and &#39; respectively. This kind of filtering will prevent XSS with HTML attribute injection.
* String encodeJavaScript(String input) - This function allows untrusted data to be safely displayed in dynamically generated JavaScript. This is mainly achieved by using JavaScript backslash-escaping. This kind of filtering will prevent XSS with JavaScript injection.

According to the claim C3 and C4, OpenMRS uses session tokens and restricts client-side scripting using a server called Tomcat. OpenMRS uses the newest versions of Tomcat (> version 7) and by default HttpOnly flag will be set by the server. The HttpOnly flag is an additional flag that is used to prevent an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) exploit from taking access to the session cookie. Because one of the most known ways of subjecting to an XSS attack is access to the session cookie, and to subsequently hijack the victimâ€™s session, the HttpOnly flag is a useful prevention mechanism where a client-side script won't be able to access the session cookie from. The link to this documentation is provided here: https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Step+3+-+Install+Tomcat

The claim C5 stating that OpenMRS performs the auto bound checking against buffer overflow is refuted. Since there is no evidence that suggests that OpenMRS has functions that performs bound checking, the evidence for claim C5 is unfulfilled. Hence, the Baconinan Probability for this top claim is 2/3 (partial confidence).

#### Case 2 - Database Query - Network Eavesdropping

The first claim to support the Top Claim in this assurance is Claim C2 which claims that OpenMRS uses two-way encryption for security. This claim can be verified from the OpenMRS Wiki (https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Security+and+Encryption#SecurityandEncryption-TwoWayEncryption) where it explains the usage of Two-Way encryption in OpenMRS. Following this claim down to C3, it claims that OpenMRS uses modern encryption algorithms. Again, referencing the wiki, we can see that OpenMRS uses the AES encryption standard with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) with 16 byte random initialization vectors. These are widely accepted secure algorithms in the cybersecurity community. A packet-capture analysis is listed as another form of evidence, but we do not currently have access to such an analysis to provide further proof that the encryption is implemented effectively.
To avoid analysis of encrypted network traffic logging of network traffic would be necessary. It can be verified that OpenMRS offers these features from their documentation on their wiki (https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Log+Manager+Module, https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Usage+Statistics+Module). The third claim affirming network security deals with endpoint protection on the client accessing the OpenMRS web application. There is no evidence that can be found dealing with OpenMRS securing endpoints.

The other C2 Claim about OpenMRS is that it only allows pre-approved clients to access the system. No resource can be found that backs up this claim, however, the C3 claim below it can be verified with role-based access controls. OpenMRS claims that it can protect the integrity of specific files using single direction encryption or hash validation (https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Security+and+Encryption#SecurityandEncryption-SingleDirectionEncryptionorHashValidation). This article from the wiki would affirm OpenMRS's ability to ensure that there are no unauthorized tampering of access control files by utilizing a SHA-512 + 128 character salt algorithm.


#### Case 3 - File Data

The first claim to support the Top Claim in this assurance is Claim C2 which claims that OpenMRS has a session locking feature which include user to be logged out after certain time of inactivity. The second claim to support the first claim in this assurance is Claim C3 which claims that OpenMRS has two factor authentication. This following link provides the proof for this claim. https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Security+and+Encryption#SecurityandEncryption-TwoWayEncryption. This shows how the two way encryption is implemented in the OpenMRS.

The third claim to support the second claim in this assurance is claim C4, one of the third claim states that openMRS has encryption and session tracking. Referring to the above link we can see that OpenMRS utilizes the AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding method for block cipher encryption and decryption. The other third claim is OpenMRS authenticates requests to each resource and provide the SSL valid certificate. This can be proved using the following link https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Security+and+Encryption#SecurityandEncryption-SingleDirectionEncryptionorHashValidation this documentation provides the detailed about how the key is exchanged during authentication and and getting the random token.  Furthermore, this documents also provides the proof for the another claim which states that OpenMRS uses hash validation functionality.


#### Case 4 - Login - Authentication Abuse

The first claim to support the Top Claim in this assurance is Claim C2 which claims that OpenMRS has the functionality of validating password complexity. OpenMRS requires the certain character to login to its page. It requires certain number of characters and only the authorized annotation has the ability to add or remove the user and their privileges. This can also be verified using the following page: https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Access+Control+in+OpenMRS 

The second claim to support the first claim in this assurance is Claim C3 which claims that OpenMRS has the functionality of two way encryption. The following link provides the evidence of this claim. https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Security+and+Encryption#SecurityandEncryption-TwoWayEncryption . Referring to this link we can see that OpenMRS utilizes the AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding method for block cipher encryption and decryption. The initialization vector is an array of 16 bytes and will only properly decrypt or encrypt if paired with a specific secret key byte array. This is widely accepted algorithm in cybersecurity community. Furthermore, this documents also provides the proof for the another claim which states that OpenMRS uses hash validation functionality. When the attacker doesnâ€™t possess the shared secret key which is responded by the server. So, the attacker uses the second connection to the server and sends it. This kind of attacks can be mitigated by using hash response from the server. 

The another C2 claim is OpenMRS provides the functionality of single direction encryption. The following link provides the proof for that claim https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Security+and+Encryption#SecurityandEncryption-SingleDirectionEncryptionorHashValidation . the hashMatches() method provides access to single direction encryption utilities by password validation and checks against both SHA1 and SHA-512 + 128 character salt algorithms. encodeString() method returns the parameter after being encoded using the OpenMRS default encryption which is currently hardcoded to SHA-512.

### Retrospective of Past Assignments (Task 4) 
---
In the meeting, each of the team members was asked to come up with at least two assurance claims on which we can have a discussion. We selected seven of them to be approved by the instructor. We discussed what factors should be chosen for coming up with the assurance cases. There was a small debate about if we should consider the individual features and data flow to come up with the assurance cases or keep our software in mind. After the approval of the claims, each of us took one claim each and discussed on the rebuttals and strategies to counter them using claims. There were no major blockers for this task. Once we had a good idea about how to approach each claim, there was no difficulty in coming up with the claims. Also, during the class, we had a good discussion about the evidence for all the claims and no major changes were made.
