### The Squadratics
### CYBR 8430 - Project Proposal
### OpenMRS - A patent based

#### Project Proposal: 2-3 page markdown document that describes the following:

* An open-source software project your team has chosen. From here on, it will be referred to as “software”.

We selected `OpenMRS` for our project, specifically the `OpenMRS-core`.

---

* An assumed/hypothetical operational environment (e.g., home, office, enterprise, bank, government, etc.) where the users will expect security functionality from the software in its intended use.

Electronic medical records are standard in most western or developed countries but due to their cost and the technical overhead they entail they haven't been adopted	as much in developing nations, espcially in rural areas.  This project aims to change that by providing an open source solution that healthcare provides and facilities can adopt regardless of their financial means.

Our examination will focus on a the core use case of electronic medical records, managing patient records at a small facility. We will be examining this...

---

* What are the security needs of users from this software in its intended threat environment ? If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your selection.
Develop a list of security features in the software. Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice.

---

* Motivation for selecting this project

This project is aimed at `resource constrained` hospital and health care providers. Those that don't typically have the ability to implement a commercial system to mange patient records.

---

* Open source project description (What is it?, Contributors, Activity, Use, Popularity, Languages used, platform, documentation sources, etc.)

---

* Discuss License, procedures for making contributions, and contributor agreements
