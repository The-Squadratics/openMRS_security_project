__Team:__ The Squadratics  
__Team Members:__ Mittranj Pansuriya, Patrick Lindsay, Jeson Rijal, Travis Ingram

### Assignment
---

The team must produce a markdown report that includes the following:

* (__Task 1__) Develop threat models for critical data-flows through the software.
  * Misuse and assurance cases will provide starting points for examination.
  * Include threat model diagrams and threat analysis.
    * Level 0 Diagrams for each use case
    * Consolidate and present DFDs for remaining cases
* (__Task 2__) Using threat model analysis, review OSS project for design related issues. Summarize your observations.
* (__Task 3__) Provide a summary of your team reflection meeting.
  * What issues occurred?
  * What did you plan to change moving forward?
* Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task.
