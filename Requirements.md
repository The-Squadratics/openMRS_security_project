### The Squadratics
### CYBR 8430 - Requirements for Software Security Engineering
### OpenMRS - A patent-based medical record system


After looking at a number of different OSS projects we decided to assess `OpenMRS` for our semester project. Specifically, the `OpenMRS-core` which is a common platform that is used to build medical data systems.

---

### Identify five essential data flows (source-transformations-sink) through the software. Provide use-cases diagrams related to each of these data flows.

---

### Derive security requirements for each of the use cases using misuse case diagrams. 

---

### Assess the alignment of security requirements with advertised features of the software.  Incorporate project documentation and observations about the codebase as evidence to support the conclusions reached.

---

### Provide a summary of the `OpenMRS` project documentation for security-related configuration and installation issues.
