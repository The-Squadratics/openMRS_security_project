### The Squadratics
### CYBR 8430 - Requirements for Software Security Engineering
### OpenMRS - A patent-based medical record system


After looking at a number of different OSS projects we decided to assess `OpenMRS` for our semester project. Specifically, the `OpenMRS-core` which is a common platform that is used to build medical data systems.

---

### Identify five essential data flows (source-transformations-sink) through the software. Provide use-cases diagrams related to each of these data flows.

---

### Derive security requirements for each of the use cases using misuse case diagrams. 

---

### Assess the alignment of security requirements with advertised features of the software.  Incorporate project documentation and observations about the codebase as evidence to support the conclusions reached.

---

### Provide a summary of the `OpenMRS` project documentation for security-related configuration and installation issues.

The security-related configuration documentation provided for the OpenMRS project is not centrally located but spread out over numerous documents on the OpenMRS wiki.

The project does provide...

Some examples of the documentation provided are listed below.
